## What is BlockOrg

In brief, BlockOrg will be an organizational and communications tool intended to aid in organizing and running an organization (prefferably in a democratic and transparent manner) using blockchain technology as the primary datastore for verification and transparency purposes.

If you have any ideas or feedback, feel free to conact me at cagox@cagox.net.

At this point in time I am still open to the use of various technologies, but for the moment the serverside API is likely to be built using golang and nginx.

For Persistence, we are still looking at various technologies. I am currently favoring either MongoDB or BoltDB. Both are solid datbases and both have extensive support from the Go community.
